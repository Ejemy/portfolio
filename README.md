# Portfolio Dev

This portfolio website was made with HTML, CSS, and JQuery. 
There is a PHP file which is to send an email to me through the contact form. However Github only 
supports static pages so I will keep the mailer.php file dead until I host this webpage somewhere else.
In the meantime I use **Formspree** to handle the contact form.
