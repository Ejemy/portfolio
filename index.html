    <p class="author-blurb">Hello, my name is Eric Iwan and I am an American living in Japan hoping to further my career as a 
      developer! Currently, I am working as an assistant language teacher but in my free time I am pursuing various projects 
      both in a team setting and by myself. The projects I work on are mostly Javascript websites and applications although I 
      have a little Python experience too. While I can do front-end work, I most enjoy working in back-end and have 
      experience with <u>Nodejs, Express, MySQL, and MongoDB</u>. I am passionate about building applications and websites that make 
      people's lives easier. I find joy (and get excited) when I am stuck on a problem because it forces me to learn new 
      technologies and libraries. Although I may have little experience in relation to others, I am told I learn and pick up
       new technologies very fast. I look forward to hearing from you and hope we can build a professional relationship together!

        to use this when we pursue future projects together. We are using a template website (unrelated to ticketing) and heavily

        This is my portfolio webpage. This is a link to the Github of the same page you are currently viewing right now.
        My passions may not be in purely front-end, however, I enjoyed writing this page up and learned quite a bit. Especially
        with JQuery functions. I have a PHP file but it is not being used because Github can only host static 
        webpages. To send contact forms I am using Formspree and when I host this website elsewhere I will use the PHP.
